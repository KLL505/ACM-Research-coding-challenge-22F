This accounts for 48.72% of the data which falls within the range of 25,000-34,999 while the more expensive cars being 45,000+ only accounted for only 12.22%. This continues the trend that more high end and expensive cars are actually less highly rated compared to cars in the low-middle range.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df_filtered['Price'].max()\ndef GetPriceRange(Price):\n    if(Price < 20000):\n        return '\\$0 - \\$19,999'\n    elif(Price < 25000):\n        return '\\$20,000 - \\$24,999'\n    elif(Price < 30000):\n        return '\\$25,000 - \\$29,999'\n    elif(Price < 35000):\n        return '\\$30,000 - \\$34,999'\n    elif(Price < 40000):\n        return '\\$35,000 - \\$39,999'\n    elif(Price < 45000):\n        return '\\$40,000 - \\$44,999'\n    elif(Price < 50000):\n        return '\\$45,000 - \\$49,999'\n    elif(Price < 55000):\n        return '\\$50,000 - \\$54,999'\n    else:\n        return '\\$55,000+'\ndf_filtered['PriceRange'] = df_filtered['Price'].apply(GetPriceRange)\nPriceValueCounts = df_filtered['PriceRange'].value_counts()\nPriceValueCounts.plot.pie(title='Price',ylabel=\"\", figsize=(10, 10),autopct=autopct,labels=labels(PriceValueCounts),textprops={'fontsize': 14})\ndf_filtered=df_filtered.drop(columns=['PriceRange'])","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-08-22T22:56:18.613324Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-08-22T22:56:18.614526Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-08-22T22:56:18.867096Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-08-22T22:56:18.614486Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-08-22T22:56:18.864752Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":206,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Color Analysis\nFor colors I plotted the data that was cleaned up in a horizontal bargraph to visually show which colors were the most present and found that nuetral colors such as black, gray, and white were the overwhelming majority of the data.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"colors =['Gray', 'Black', 'White', 'Blue', 'Red', 'Pink', 'Green', 'Brown', 'Orange', 'Yellow']\nColorValueCounts = df_filtered['ExteriorColor'].value_counts()\nColorValueCounts.sort_values().plot(title='Exterior Color',ylabel=\"Count\",xlabel='Color', kind = 'barh',figsize=(7, 7), color=colors[::-1], edgecolor = \"black\", fontsize=14)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-08-22T22:56:18.868816Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-08-22T22:56:18.869376Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-08-22T22:56:19.110475Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-08-22T22:56:18.869339Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-08-22T22:56:19.109518Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":207,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I then plotted the data into a pie chart so get the percentages of the colors and found that gray, black, and white made up 30.36%, 29.5%, and 16.48% respectively.
