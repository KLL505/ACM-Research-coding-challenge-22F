# Basic Info

This project will clean up the data from the cars_raw.csv file and then filter this data to the 75th percentile of the highest rated cars according to consumers which are calculated using a Bayesian model that factors in not only the average rating but the number of reviews aswell. This filtered data will then be analyzed to determine the most common characteristics of these highly rated cars and visuaized with the use of pie charts and graphs. Please see the acm-coding-challenge.ipynb file where I go into more detail on the methodology and equations used to analyze the data.

This was my first time using python and my first time working on a project related to data science. When I first saw this coding challenge, I was intimidated because I've never done anything similar, however, I really wanted to challenge myself and expand my skills so I decided to try it out and learn a new language in the process. Using Kaggle took some time to understand and additionally it took around 4 hours to complete this project with all the research and documentation I had to go through in order to understand what I was doing. However, in the end, I did feel like I learned quite a lot about python and how to use it to manipulate and analyze datasets, and I'm glad I attempted the challenge in the first place.
